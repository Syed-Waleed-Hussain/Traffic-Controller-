# 🚦 Digital Logic Design (DLD) - Traffic Controller  

📌 **Project Report**  

## 🎯 Main Objective  
Our goal is to develop a **four-way traffic signal system** that efficiently manages intersections, making it safer and easier for vehicles and pedestrians to navigate through busy traffic areas.  

## 🏗️ Introduction  
This project aims to address traffic management challenges by designing and implementing a **four-way traffic signal system**. The system utilizes **electronic components and control mechanisms** to regulate traffic flow and enhance safety.  

## ⚙️ Methodology  
- The circuit is built on a **breadboard**.  
- A **button** generates clock pulses for operation.  
- **Power supply** is stabilized using **capacitors and resistors**.  
- The **CD4017 Decade Counter IC** is used for sequential control with **10 outputs**.  
- **Diodes** are used to control current flow, while **LEDs** and **resistors** ensure safe operation.  
- On each **clock pulse**, the IC shifts the output to the next stage, simulating traffic light changes.
